# keycloak-script-provider-uploader
Utility to install Keycloak script providers from the command line

## Usage
`python script_provider_uploader.py`

By default, the script will:
* Look for a namespace including the words "domino" and "platform" in your current kubectl context.
* Look for the first Keycloak pod in a statefulSet (i.e. ending `-0`) in that namespace.
* Look for files ending in `-authenticator.js`, `-mapper.js` and `-policy.js` in your current directory.
* Build a .jar file with the appropriate file structure and metadata JSON file.
* Compress the .jar file and copy it to your Keycloak pod.

You can supply any number of Javascript script provider files when you run the updater scriptâ€“ you don't have to have an authenticator, a mapper and a policy.

## Customisation
If your Keycloak instance does not run in a namespace that includes both `domino` and `platform`, you can override this with the environment variable `KEYCLOAK_NAMESPACE`.

`export KEYCLOAK_NAMESPACE=keycloak-namespace; python script_provider_uploader.py`

You specify another directory for your Javascript script providers like so:
`python script_provider_uploader.py /path/to/javascript/files`
The path can be relative to the uploader script (`./javascript/files`) or absolute, as above.
